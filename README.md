# MAC address format changer

It's common for different services to use MAC addresses in different formats. Cisco uses dots, Windows prints dashes, others use colons. This tool gives you quick access to all of them, as well as a history.

# Usage

Simply paste a valid MAC in any format into the top box and click convert. The boxes below will populate with converted formats. Click the copy button next to a given style to copy it to your clipboard. 

The log will show a time stamp and all four formats for each conversion. This persists until you close the tool.

Minimising sends the tool to the systray, where clicking it will re-open the tool.

# CLI

You can launch the program from a command line, with the first argument of a MAC address, and it will auto convert and populate the fields.
